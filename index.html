                    After finishing my graduation it seemed natural for me to continue studying and enroll in a master's degree,
                    but by the end of the first semester I started to feel frustrated. It's very rewarding to grasp the knowledge you get from college,
                    but after a few years it gets discouraging. I wanted more. More experience, more responsibility, more visibility.
                    I felt it was time for me to learn by doing, working side by side with more experienced designers, in a professional environment.

                    When I started looking for a job I came across this small, exciting company called <a href="https://groupbuddies.com/">
                    Group Buddies</a>. I got in touch with them and soon I had a Skype call with Roberto (CEO) who told me about the
                    <a href="http://apprenticeship.groupbuddies.com/#/">apprenticeship program</a>. It took me by surprise at the time,
                    but after a few days it made perfect sense. I wanted to feel the weight of responsibility although I wasn't sure if
                    I'd be ready to handle it, and working with a team that deals with that everyday seemed to be the perfect way for me to
                    learn just how to do it. This apprenticeship would teach me how to work with real design problems, taking a design thinking approach.
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        [Apprenticeship] It's an unfashionable word with connotations of servility and poverty, but no matter what you call it,
                        serving an apprenticeship is a necessary and unavoidable step on the road to becoming a mature designer.
                        And it needn't be a dispiriting experience. The energizing charge that comes from learning from more experienced designers is
                        invigorating. In design college you are thrown in with others in the same predicament as yourself.

                    You never know if you're ready to do something until you start doing it. I never thought too much about it, but these two months
                    were the period of time when I discovered more gaps in my knowledge. This wasn't by any means a bad thing, because the more mistakes
                    I made the more I would improve. They never gave me solutions, they showed me how to get there by thinking about the problem from the
                    ground up, defying every assumption I made and exploring as much as possible, never being satisfied with an "acceptable" iteration.
                    They were, and still are, a team that supports me and helps me grow, by pushing me far beyond my known limits.

                        It refers to having an attitude of openness, of eagerness. You drop your heavy preconceptions and revitalize a practice by finding
                        a new way to look at it.

                    I will always remember the first project I worked on during the apprenticeship for a multitude of reasons.
                    One of them is because I had never done so many iterations for a project in my life. Whenever I thought I was on to something
                    and confidently showed someone my great achievement, I was sure that after talking with that person I would do three or four more
                    iterations. Their standards are so high that they forced me to always do better and never feel satisfied with what I'd produced.
                    I started working each element of the product as if that element alone was also a product. An element can only become a part of the
                    product prototype when it shows a lot of thinking went into designing it and that's the most important thing that I've learned in
                    Group Buddies.

                    Everything is thoughtfully crafted and reviewed several times. It's this craftsmanship that distinguishes good design from great design
                    and GB is definitely striving to be great.

                    In <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1772925/">"Dreams of Sushi"</a>, Jiro Ono shows us that in order to achieve excellence you
                    have to be in love with what you do. It must be part of your life. In Jiro's sushi bar, it takes 10 years of dedicated work to be
                    considered a master craftsman. I often find myself thinking of solutions for something I'm working on when I'm not at work or I'm doing
                    things that have nothing to do with it. When I lie down at night I never fall asleep without thinking a bit on the project I'm working on.
                    It comes naturally, I don't control it. This makes it cristal clear for me that I'm doing what I love.

                    product creation processes. It's by repeating these processes that you grow, improving a little bit more every time you do it.

                    This experience has dramatically changed the way I perceive design and how I work. It made me more perceptive and patient.

            Mobile web applications are expected to work differently from desktop applications. They need to feel responsive to the user's touch.
            Having worked on a couple of mobile web applications in the last year, I found that I always start by changing the browser's default
            appearance and behaviour. This article contains my setup to make a mobile web application feel more like a native one.
        </p>

        <h1>CSS Reset</h1>

        <p>The following is a set of rules I use in every mobile web application. Keep in mind that some of these are my personal preference.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="src/code1.bmp"/>
        </p>
        <p>When using a mobile framework, like <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">ionic</a>, you usually don't need to worry about this, it's already there.
            Also, remember to run these styles through <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">autoprefixer</a>, since you'll need the vendor
            prefixes.</p>

        <h1>Prevent user scaling</h1>
        <p>To adjust the browser's viewport for a mobile application you can use the following meta tag:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="src/code2.bmp"/>
            <img src="src/code2.1.bmp"/>
        </p><br/><br/>
        <p>The <img src="src/code3.bmp"/> part sets the width of the viewport as the width of the device.</p>
        <p>The <img src="src/code4.bmp"/> property controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded, and the <img src="src/code5.bmp"/>
            property prevents the user from zooming in and out on your mobile application.</p>

        <h1>Overscroll</h1>
        <p>
            Most mobile browsers have an "elastic" overscroll for the entire page. This is the reason why, in some web sites, you can pull down the
            header (that's fixed on the top), revealing a empty layer behind the application. You usually don't want this.
        </p>
        <p>
            On <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a>, pasting the following rules in the <img src="src/code6.bmp"/>
            file should do the trick of disabling the overscroll.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="src/code7.bmp"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            On a regular browser you can disable the touchmove on the document, which obtains the same result.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="src/code8.bmp"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though you don't want a full page overscroll, some places of the application may require scroll. For those places you can enable
            it with the following rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="src/code9.bmp"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that on the JavaScript we are excluding the class <img src="src/code10.bmp"/>. You need to add this class to the places you want
            scrollable content. The <img src="src/code11.bmp"> enables the "momentum" style scrolling.
        </p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            The tips I've shared should be helpful for every application. But it doesn't stop here. There is much more you can do to improve the
            look and feel of a mobile web application, but I'll leave that for another blog post.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who don't see the web as a viable platform for mobile, give it another chance. You might end up feeling utterly surprised.
        </p>
